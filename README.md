To get the Firebase configuration details like `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, and others, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Open your web browser and go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   
2. **Create a Firebase Project (If you don't have one):**
   - Click on the "Add project" button.
   - Follow the steps to create a new Firebase project. You'll need to give it a name, agree to the terms, and enable or disable Google Analytics for the project.

3. **Get Firebase Config for Web:**
   - Once the project is created, click on the project you just created.
   - In the Firebase console, click on the gear icon in the top left corner (next to Project Overview) and select "Project settings".
   - Scroll down to the "Your apps" section.
   - Select the platform you want (in this case, select the Web app).
   - If you haven't already, you might be asked to register your app with Firebase by providing a nickname.
   - Once your app is registered, you’ll see the Firebase SDK snippet that contains the configuration details (like `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc.).

4. **Copy the Config:**
   - Copy the config object provided. It will look something like this:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-app-id.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-app-id.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
     appId: "your-app-id",
     measurementId: "your-measurement-id"  // This is optional
   };
   ```
   - Use this `firebaseConfig` object in your JavaScript code to initialize Firebase.


The JSON configuration consists **Firebase Service Account Key** used for server-side authentication when interacting with Firebase services like Firestore, Firebase Admin SDK, and more. To generate and download this key, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. **Select Your Project:**
   - In the Firebase Console, select the project you want to generate the service account key for (in this case, `urs-app-2`).

3. **Navigate to Project Settings:**
   - In the Firebase Console, click the **gear icon** next to "Project Overview" in the top left corner and select **Project settings**.

4. **Service Accounts Tab:**
   - In the project settings, go to the **Service accounts** tab.

5. **Generate New Private Key:**
   - Click on the **Generate New Private Key** button. A warning will pop up, informing you that this private key gives full access to your Firebase project. 
   - Confirm that you want to generate the key, and Firebase will download the key file in JSON format to your local system.

6. **Store the File Securely:**
   - The downloaded file contains the service account credentials in the JSON format you're referring to. **Ensure that this file is stored securely** and not exposed in your client-side code or version control (e.g., GitHub).

7. **Use the Key in Your Project:**
   - You can now use this file in your Firebase Admin SDK setup to authenticate your server-side application with Firebase services.
  
Here’s a dummy example of a service account key JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "dummy-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "dummy-private-key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----------END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "client_email": "dummy-firebase-adminsdk@dummy-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "dummy-client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/dummy-firebase-adminsdk%40dummy-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```

This is a dummy structure with placeholder values to help you understand the format of the service account key JSON. You would replace the values with the actual credentials you obtain from the Google Cloud Console.
