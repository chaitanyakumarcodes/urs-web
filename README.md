### **URS Application: Vendor Registration & Dashboard**

#### **Overview:**
The code provided outlines the URS (Unified Rewards System) application: the Vendor Registration page and the Analytics Dashboard. This system is designed to allow vendors to register, manage their transactions, and monitor key metrics via visual analytics and charts.

### **Technologies Used:**
1. **HTML:** Standard markup language used for creating the structure of the web pages.
2. **CSS (TailwindCSS):** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the web pages. Tailwind allows easy creation of responsive, modern UIs with predefined classes.
3. **Font Awesome:** Used for adding icons to the UI (e.g., store icon, lock icon) to enhance the visual experience.
4. **Chart.js:** A JavaScript library used to create interactive and dynamic charts. It's used extensively in the dashboard to present data in various formats like bar and line charts.
5. **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Provides functionality such as tab switching, chart initialization, API calls, and date range selection.
6. **Flask (Python Backend):** Although not explicitly mentioned in the code, the `url_for()` and `/api/` endpoints suggest a Flask backend is powering the application.
7. **Firebase (Firestore Database):** For storing the data related to the customers, vendors, and the reward policies.

    - **Functionality**: Fetches transaction data from the backend and populates a table with transaction details such as ID, amount, points earned, and time of transaction.
    - **Usefulness**: Offers vendors a detailed history of their transactions to manage their business operations better.

- **Date Range Selector:**
    - **Functionality**: Allows users to select predefined date ranges (e.g., Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days) or specify custom start and end dates for viewing analytics.
    - **Usefulness**: Empowers users to filter and analyze data within specific time frames, which is critical for decision-making.

- **Transaction Export:**
    - **Functionality**: Enables users to export transaction data in various formats (CSV, PDF, etc.).
    - **Usefulness**: Allows vendors to download reports for offline analysis, record-keeping, or further processing.

- **Data Auto-Refresh:**
    - **Functionality**: Periodically reloads the data (every 5 minutes) to keep the dashboard up-to-date.
    - **Usefulness**: Ensures vendors always have the latest data without manually refreshing the page.

- **Error Handling:**

4. **Copy the Config:**
   - Copy the config object provided. It will look something like this:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-app-id.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-app-id.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
     appId: "your-app-id",
     measurementId: "your-measurement-id"  // This is optional
   };
   ```
   - Use this `firebaseConfig` object in your JavaScript code to initialize Firebase.


The JSON configuration consists **Firebase Service Account Key** used for server-side authentication when interacting with Firebase services like Firestore, Firebase Admin SDK, and more. To generate and download this key, follow these steps:
